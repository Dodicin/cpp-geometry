# cpp-geometry

A collection of geometric algorithm implementations.

# Structure
- `include/` contains the headers of the library with the algorithms implementations'
- `src/` contains the source code for the demos.
- `lib/` contains the statically linked libraries.
- `res/` contains various resources for OpenGL (shaders, etc).
- `demos/` contains precompiled visual demos of the algorithms.

# Progress:
- [x] Minor utilities
- [x] Convex hull (Graham scan variation)
- [ ] Voronoi diagram generation (Fortune's algorithm)
- [ ] OpenGL demos
