# cpp-geometry

A collection of geometric algorithm implementations in C++.

# Structure
- `include/` contains the headers of the library with the algorithms implementations.
- `test/` contains the unit tests.

# Progress:
## Geometry library
- [x] Minor utilities
- [x] Convex hull (Graham scan variation)
- [ ] Voronoi diagram generation (Fortune's algorithm)
